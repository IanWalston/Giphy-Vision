This website uses the giphy API to obtain 10 random giphs of a given topic, then uses the Google Vision API to provide annotation for those images. 

The annotation from the Google Vision API is a few labeling descriptions such as "plant" or "forehead, percentage representing how closely this description matches the image. Rather than describing the entire literal content, the descriptions attempt to guess the overall focus of the image. For example, images of people often return descriptions such as "chin" or "hairstyle" depending on what appears to be a prominent feature of the image.
